### 📝 Early Checks Before Descriptive Statistics  

As outlined in **Assignment 1**, our task is to conduct a *thorough descriptive analysis at the district level* using structural data from the *Statistische Ämter des Bundes und der Länder (2025)*.  
The evaluation criteria highlight that our code must be **complete, robust, efficient, and supported by a clear line of argumentation**.  

In this spirit, we first run a set of **early readiness checks** before descriptive statistics. While `.describe()` will always produce output, such results may be misleading if data types are wrong, missing values are not accounted for, or duplicates exist.  

We refer to our dataset in code as **`idt_df`**, which stands for *Internet & Database Technology DataFrame*. This naming convention makes it explicit that this DataFrame contains the raw data used for our Internet & Database Technology assignment, namely, *ew24_structure_data.xlsx*.  

These checks help us establish confidence in the dataset’s structure before performing statistical summaries:  
1. **Structure** – How many rows and columns are there?  
2. **Data types** – Are numeric variables correctly recognized, or stored as text?  
3. **Sample values** – Do the first few rows make sense in context?  
4. **Missingness** – Which variables contain missing values, and how extensive are they?  
5. **Duplicates** – Are there duplicate rows that could distort later results?  

These steps do **not yet clean or prepare** the dataset, but they align with the assignment’s focus on **robustness** and **argumentation**, ensuring that later descriptive statistics will be valid and interpretable.  

import pandas as pd

# Load raw data (adjust path if necessary)
idt_df = pd.read_excel("ew24_structure_data.xlsx")

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# EARLY CHECKS BEFORE RUNNING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Dataset structure
print("Shape (rows, cols):", idt_df.shape)
print("\nColumn names:\n", idt_df.columns.tolist())
# --> Helps confirm what each row/column represents.

# 2. Data types
print("\nColumn dtypes:\n", idt_df.dtypes)
# --> 'object' may mean text, but could also hide numbers stored as strings.

# 3. Sample values
print("\nHead (first 5 rows):\n", idt_df.head())
# --> Quick reality check: do the values match our expectations?

# 4. Missing values
print("\nMissing values per column:\n", idt_df.isna().sum())
# --> Important: descriptives do not distinguish between "0" and "missing".

# 5. Duplicate rows
print("\nNumber of duplicate rows:", idt_df.duplicated().sum())
# --> Prevents certain districts being counted twice.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# These are sanity checks, not data cleaning.
# They ensure our descriptive statistics later on
# reflect the true structure of the dataset.

### 📝 Interpreting the Early Checks  

The results of these readiness checks guide how we approach descriptive statistics:  

- If **many columns appear as `object`**, we must inspect whether they are truly text (e.g., names, codes) or numeric data stored as strings (e.g., "34%").  
- If there is **extensive missingness**, we need to decide how to treat those variables (drop, impute, or note as a limitation).  
- If **duplicate rows** exist, we need to investigate whether they are data errors or reflect genuine cases.  
- If values look implausible (e.g., negative populations, percentages > 100), we must flag them for correction before analysis.  

By interpreting these checks, we ensure that subsequent descriptive statistics are **robust, interpretable, and consistent with the assignment’s evaluation criteria**.  




<!-- What to compare with your columns (quick checklist) -->

1) Population change mechanics: birth_balance_per_1000 vs migration_balance_per_1000 (who grows how). 

2) Structure & density: population_density…, % foreigners, age bands (under 16 / 16–17 / 18–24 / 25–34 / 35–59 / 60–74 / 75+).

3) Housing pressure & stock: completed_dwellings_per_1000, stock_of_dwellings_per_1000, residential_space_per_dwelling, residential_space_per_inhabitant.

4) Prosperity & output: disposable_income_per_inhabitant, gdp_per_inhabitant.

5) Labour market: unemployment_rate_total (+ men/women/youth/55–64).

6) Business dynamics: business_total_per_1000, business_craft_per_1000.

7) Mobility & urban form: car_stock_per_1000, cars_electric_or_hybrid_pct, settlement_and_traffic_pct vs vegetation_and_water_pct.

8) Family & inclusion: childcare rates (under 3; 3–<6), sgb_ii_recipients_per_1000 (+ % foreigners, % non-working).

9) Economic structure: social-insurance contribution shares (agri, manufacturing, trade/hospitality/transport, public/private services, other).
