European Elections 2024 â€“ Structural Data Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is part of Assignment 1 for our university course. It is a group work, graded project focusing on a descriptive analysis of structural data at the district level for Germany in the context of the 2024 European elections.

The dataset provided (ew24_structure_data.xlsx) includes demographic, economic, housing, education, and labor market indicators for all districts.
Our goal is to explore patterns, distributions, and relationships across German districts and provide insights into regional structures.
